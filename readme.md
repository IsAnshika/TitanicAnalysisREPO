# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves the analysis of the Titanic dataset to gain insights into passenger demographics and survival patterns, as well as building predictive models for survival.

## Dataset Source

The Titanic dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle website. You can find the dataset and additional information [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data).

## Dependencies

To run the code in this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Purpose 
This code aims to analyze the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning techniques. It starts by loading the dataset and preprocessing it to prepare for model training.

## Results

**Data Preprocessing** The code preprocesses the dataset by handling missing values and converting categorical variables into numerical format.
**Model Training** Logistic Regression is used as the machine learning algorithm for predicting survival. The model is trained on the preprocessed data.
**Model Evaluation** The accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using both the training and validation datasets. This helps assess how well the model generalizes to new data.
**Accuracy** The trained model achieves an accuracy score of [81.32%] on the training dataset and [75.41%] on the validation dataset.
